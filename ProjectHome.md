NOTE: This repo contains gamemodes from Garry's Mod 12, they will need to be updated for them to work in the current version of Garry's Mod. An updated version of the Fretta base gamemode can be found in this thread: http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1217955

A compilation of all known GMod 12 Fretta gamemodes. This svn serves a purpose to provide a more permanent solution of hosting fretta gamemodes. Many which are hosted on this repository seem to be lost from most of the internet.
